    <li><b>How do I download themes?</b></li> Go to the Downloads category and browse the channels to see which theme you would want to download.
    <li><b>Can I get BetterDiscord support from here?</b></li>
    No. Go join the official BetterDiscord servers given in info . Though occasionally, we can answer a few BD related questions or relay important announcements.
    <li><b>How do I get a tag?</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tags will look like this:</li>
    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/644175893308243968/646019773972480000/2019-11-19_00-10-29.gif"></img>
    <br>
    <br>
    And you can get them by donating at least 5USD to Monstrum#3557 in <a href=https://goo.gl/9S8VGb>https://goo.gl/9S8VGb</a> with a message containing your User#0000. Upon confirmation, she will DM you herself. Because anything lower than that
    basically just gets absorbed by PayPal and I get a grand total of 0.
    <li><b>How do I get a tag with the image?</b> Those are special tags. Donate at least 10USD to Monstrum#3557 on <a href=https://goo.gl/9S8VGb>https://goo.gl/9S8VGb</a> with a message containing your User#0000--or you can get them if I like you.
      The price is the way it is because these tags have longer codes and look more eye catching, and also available in most (if not all) BB themes--you get something special and flashy. I know not a lot of people will get it so it's a lot more
      special that way. Donator tags look like this:</li>
    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/644175893308243968/646020341809938453/2019-11-19_00-13-48.gif"></img>
    <li>I want the <div class="highest-donator"><b>♔ | Highest Donator | ♔</b></div> role. How do I get it?
      You have to have a highest donation in one donation, not overall. $5 today and $5 tomorrow doesn't count as a $10 and the role.</li>
    <li><b> How do I get a custom Discord banner?</b></li>
    Custom Discord banner looks like this:
    <div class="video"><video width="400" controls>
        <source src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/644175893308243968/646020609146355731/popouts.mp4" type="video/mp4">
